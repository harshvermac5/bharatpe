Here's a brief description of each function in the code, explained in a way that a beginner can understand:

---

### `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {...});`
This is an event listener that waits for the HTML document to be fully loaded before executing the code inside the function. It ensures that all the elements in the DOM (Document Object Model) are available before any JavaScript manipulations.

---

### `fetch('./bharatpe.json')`
This part loads a JSON file (`bharatpe.json`) from the server using the `fetch` API. It retrieves the data and processes it in the subsequent `.then()` blocks.

---

### `createDropdowns(obj, parentKey = '')`
This function dynamically creates dropdown menus (select elements) based on the JSON data passed to it. 

- **Parameters**:
  - `obj`: The JSON object or array that contains the data for creating the dropdown.
  - `parentKey`: The key that indicates the parent section (e.g., "BharatPe") in the hierarchy.
- It first checks if the data is valid (object or array). Then, it creates a `<select>` element and populates it with `<option>` elements for each key in the object, unless the key is 'output'.
- When the user selects an option, it either displays an array directly or creates new dropdowns for nested data.

---

### `clearDropdowns(container, currentSelect)`
This function removes any dropdowns that appear after the current one. This is done to keep the UI clean and ensure that only the relevant dropdowns are visible based on the user's selections.

- **Parameters**:
  - `container`: The container (typically a `<div>`) where the dropdowns are appended.
  - `currentSelect`: The currently selected dropdown, which is used as a reference to remove the following dropdowns.

---

### `displayArray(arr, key)`
This function displays an array directly in the output section when an array is selected from a dropdown.

- **Parameters**:
  - `arr`: The array to be displayed.
  - `key`: The key (name) of the array in the JSON data, which is used for the title of the displayed list.

It generates an unordered list (`<ul>`) where each item in the array is listed as a list item (`<li>`).

---

### `displayDetails(optionData, optionName)`
This function displays the details of the selected option (either an object or a simple value) in the output area.

- **Parameters**:
  - `optionData`: The data associated with the selected option (it could be a string, number, or object).
  - `optionName`: The name of the selected option, used for display purposes.

If the option data is an object and has a key `output` set to "true", it formats the object for display. Otherwise, it simply shows the value or displays a message saying "No details to display".

---

### `formatObject(obj, indent = '')`
This function formats an object (which may contain nested objects and arrays) into a human-readable HTML format for display.

- **Parameters**:
  - `obj`: The object to be formatted.
  - `indent`: A string that adds spaces for indentation, helping to visualize nested objects.
  
It loops through the keys in the object, handles arrays and nested objects separately, and recursively calls itself for nested objects to build a structured view.

---

Each of these functions works together to create a dynamic, interactive UI that allows users to explore and interact with the hierarchical JSON data. The dropdowns allow users to select different options, and based on their selection, the page updates to show either further dropdowns, detailed information, or arrays.
